This app allows tenants in New York City to search for the municipal rat and bedbug inspection history of an apartment before signing a lease. 
This app began as a paired programming project but has since expanded to include a second API from New York City's open data portal.          
Built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SASS and RESTful APIs
